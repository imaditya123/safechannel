# SafeChannel

SafeChannel is a secure communication platform designed to facilitate private messaging and file sharing. It ensures encrypted communication between users, providing an extra layer of privacy for sensitive conversations.

## Features

- **File Sharing**: Users can send and receive files safely, with encryption protecting the contents.
- **Private Messaging**: Send and receive messages in a secure, private environment without fear of eavesdropping.
- **User Authentication**: Users must authenticate before sending or receiving messages to ensure the integrity of the communication.
